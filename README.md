## Run this project in your Local Machine. . .

First, Clone this project by ->

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/muneem914/ai_chat_applicaiton.git
```
Then type ->
```bash
    cd ai_chat_applicaiton
```
Then you need to install npm packages. For this type ->
```bash
    npm install
```
And then will you be able to run this locally ? 
Not at all ! 

Create a `.env.local` file in the main project directory. Then use these api keys and model:
```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_LAMBDA_API_KEY=AIzaSyBi4lbMeajByOGh1Z71-UWQSlijvFwB2P8
    NEXT_PUBLIC_LAMBDA_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-exp
```
Finally! run ->
```bash
    npm run dev
```
## As simple as that!

Or, if you are lazy like me, don't worry, I am available on Vercel.
